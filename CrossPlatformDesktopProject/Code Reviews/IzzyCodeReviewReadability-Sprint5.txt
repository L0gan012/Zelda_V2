Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
	Readable: File and variable names make sense, correspond to usage and
    relationship with the rest of the program.

    Not readable: There are lots of literal strings and hard-coded constants.
    It is very unclear what the meanings of those constants are and how they
    relate to the program. File had comments, which I deleted for fear of
    deductions.
