Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
	What is readable: Both fields that are present have understandable names. Methods are a bit complex so this might be the case
	where a comment about what the method is supposed to do would be benefical. Methods tend to be on the longer side but the
	headers give a pretty descriptive indication to what is happening.

	What is not readable: Some of the logical steps inside the door methods can be a bit confusing. Again this might be a good time
	for a comment. Besides that everything has an adequate name and can be followed without being the implementer.
