Specific comments on code quality
	The file is a sprite factory, so it naturally has tighter coupling. It
    depends heavily on the enemy texture sheet, but it uses a dictionary to
    separate each enemy. Each method is one line long, and constructs sprites
    using their constructors. Overall, the code quality is good. 

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
	If we were to add more enemies to the texture sheets, the only thing that
    would have to change is that we would have to create a new method that
    creates the new enemy sprite from the dictionary.
