Specific comments on code quality
    This file is an abstract class for rooms. It factors out a lot of code, so
    that is good because it reduces repeated code and shortens other classes. It
    refers to objects by their interface type only, so it has pretty loose
    coupling. Methods are on the longer side, because they have to look through
    a lot of lists. There is some duplicate code in LoadRoom() . Overall the
    code quality is fairly good.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
	The file relies heavily on the format of the XML file. If the format were to
    somehow change, this could cause difficulties because some methods would
    need to substantially rewritten.
