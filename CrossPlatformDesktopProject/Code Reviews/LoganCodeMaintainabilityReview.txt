Specific comments on code quality
	The class has a decent amount of coupling. This can be expected since it is a collision handler class. However, the single method in the class uses interface types for its parameters so it has slightly looser
	coupling than if it used the dynamic types. The interesting thing about the class however is while it seems like it handles any usable item colliding with a wall there are some static properties being set
	specifically for the swords projectile. (We have been having trouble with the sword/sword projectile) I assume this was a temporary fix for an issue with the sword.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
	A possible chagne would be to figure out a less coupled way to deal with the sword. This seems to be the only thing that really effects the code quality of the class. Based on what we have currently for the
	sword and sword projectile I am not sure how easily this can be changed without completely reworking both of those classes.
