Specific comments on code quality
	The class has pretty loose coupling, because it deals with IGameObjects which is a very broad interface. However, it uses casting a lot which could possibly be avoided by having slightly tighter coupling.
	A lot of different collision events are hard-coded, and the HandleAllEvents() method is pretty long, so it could possibly be simplified. The use of for each loops makes it easy to make sure every object is 
	checked.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
	A possible chagne would be to change what game objects are allowed to interact. Right now, enemies do not collide with each other, so they don't need to be checked for collision. If this changed, 
	the class may not easily support it, since a lot of the individual interactions are specifically coded for. I think that this is partially unavoidable, since most collisions between two objects behave 
	differently depending on what type each object is.
