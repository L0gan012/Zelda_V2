Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
	What is readable: 
	Class name and method name are descriptive. The naming convention meets the c# standard. 
	The class is within 100 lines, and methods are also short.

	What is not readable: 
	The variable "junk" sort of confused me. I'm not sure why it is named "junk". 
	It would be better to have some comments explainning those loops and if statement.
