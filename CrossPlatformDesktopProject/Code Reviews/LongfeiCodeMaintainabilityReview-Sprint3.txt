Specific comments on code quality
	Everything is maintainable. 

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
	The rectangle field is related to the size of sprite. If we need an object which needs smaller hitbox than its actual sprite size, some changes will need to be done. I think this change is easy to handle.
