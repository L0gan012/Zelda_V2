Specific comments on code quality
	The class has high coupling due to many string literals. This however is acceptable because it deals with XML
	writing which the professor did not need to have low coupling since more often than not the format of the XML file
	would not change when adding more functionality. The class itself is fairly cohesive as it all deals with writing
	to an XML file. However, the method for writing each gameobject to the file is very long and could be separated to
	increase cohesion of the XMLUpdater method.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
	A change that I would make to this class is to separate the XMLUpdater method into different methods depending
	on the interface type. This would increase cohesion and decrease coupling for each update method.
