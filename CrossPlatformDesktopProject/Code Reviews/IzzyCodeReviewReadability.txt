Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
	Readable: Method, class and variable names make sense and are clear yet
    succint. Load content method is cohesive despite its length, and does
    appropriate functions based on its name

    Method and variable names make sense, methods behave accordingly to with
    their names. Organization of the class makes sense.

    Not readable: Name is confusing with reference to the IGameObject interface.
    One unnamed variable. Cohesion is a little low, it is unclear what the
    purpose of the class is.
