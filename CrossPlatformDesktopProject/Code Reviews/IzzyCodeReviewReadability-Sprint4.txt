Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
	Readable: Method and variable names make sense, file has a descriptive name.
    Methods behave according to their names and the file is short enough that it
    is not overwhelming.

    Not readable: There are a few methods that don't do anything. There is an
    overload of Update that doesn't do anything, it is unclear why it is there.
