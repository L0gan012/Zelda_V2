Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
	What is readable: Variables all have good understandable names. Methods have the default names which are acceptable and very cohesive with its contents.
Name conventations match the standards of c#. 
	What is not readable: There is not really anything in particular tha isn't readable. As a personal preference I like comments to know what things are supposed to do. For instance in the draw
	method it would be nice to know what link and sword sprite are supposed to be drawn so others who didn't work on it can tell if it is indeed working correctly. This is not an issue with
	this code though because we were told to eliminate comments from the files.
