Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
	What is readable: All instance variables have good descriptive names. Cohesion is pretty good, everything in the class has to do with dectecting collision between objects. Not much else I can 
	say about the readability of the class.

	What is not readable: There is a lot of formatting issues that could be solved such as removal of unnecessary spaces, left in testing comments. Additionally, there are methods for wide band and narrow
	band collision detection that are hard to tell what the difference is. I know comments are not really looked well upon but in this instance I think it would be a benefit to include comments so others
	can disingush the difference between the two detections.
