Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
	What is readable: The class only has two fields both with understandable names. Additionally, the class is a singleton and is named Instance which is good. Methods are all very short, have understandable names,
	and the method bodies are simple as well. Comments are used to indicate issues with some of the sounds. It looks like these are still being worked on. Lastly, it seems there are some methods/sounds at the
	end of the file that still need to be tested or removed.

	What is not readable: There is really nothing that isn't readable. Some minor things would be cleaning up spacing and new lines so everything follows a consistent format. Additionally, the comments are fine
	right now as they indicate WIP but should be removed later on.
