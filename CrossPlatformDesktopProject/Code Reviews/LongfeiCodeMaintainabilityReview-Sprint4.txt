Specific comments on code quality
	Short class, short methods, and no magic numbers, so it's easy for others to maintain. 

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
	Right now the selector in paused state cannot move, might need to be hooked to command and controller.
