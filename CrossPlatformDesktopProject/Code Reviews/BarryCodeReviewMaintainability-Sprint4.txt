Specific comments on code quality
	Game1, SpriteBatch, and IController are all things this class knows about.  This seems pretty reasonable, and
	is pretty low coupling for this game state class..
	Good attention to naming conventions.  No out of control complexity in the code. Clear and easy to read.
Hypothetical change:
	Cohesion could be improved slightly by not including hp within this class.  It's only a float,
	so there's really no coupling concerns, however, using it as the counter for game state doesn't
	fit as nicely as something could.
