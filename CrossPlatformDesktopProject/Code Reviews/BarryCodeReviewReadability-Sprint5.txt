Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
	What is readable: 
		Mostly everyting is readable.  The naming is easy enough to understand and know what they mean.
	What is not readable: 
		 There's definitely some confusion with multiple misspellings of highest (Hightest).  I also feel like the Draw method is tougher to read because of the way the repeated constants are lined up.  I think
		 what might be a good refactoring choice here would be to string the coordinate constants together and have:
		..... "Highest Score: ", Constant.HighScoreLabelPosition;
		......highestScore.ToString(), Constant.HighScorePosition;
		......"Current Score: ", Constant.CurrentScoreLabelPosition;
		......currentScore.ToString(), Constant.CurrentScorePosition;
