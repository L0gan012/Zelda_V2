Specific comments on code quality
    This file is a command to modify the music selections. It does not really
    follow the command design pattern, as it handles three different
    functionalities - volume up, volume down, and mute. It also directly checks
    if specific keys a pressed, which is functionality intended only for the
    controller. This is counter to the dictionary in the keyboard controller,
    which maps keyboard keys to individual commands. Instead three keys are all
    mapped to this command, which handles those three different functionalities
    in its Execute() method. It also does not work. 

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
	A hypothetical change I would make would be to change the keys that control
    volume. This file would not handle it well, since it hard-codes the keys
    that determine whether or not to execute that functionality. This file
    would have to specifically change those hard-coded values.
