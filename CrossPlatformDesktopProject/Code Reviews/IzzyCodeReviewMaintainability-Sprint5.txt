Specific comments on code quality
    This file is one of the game state classes. It has quite a few dependencies,
    but only two of them are classes/interfaces designed by us. Still, it might
    be a good idea to try and reduce the coupling. Additionally, the cohesion of
    the class could use some work. The constructor loads graphical content
    while also assigning initial values.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
	A hypothetical change I would make would be to remove the game property (since
    game is a singleton), remove the creation of the spritebatch because it is
    already a parameter of draw and is never used, factor out the loadcontent
    calls to a different class.
