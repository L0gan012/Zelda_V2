Specific comments on code quality
	Everything is maintainable. 

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
	The code relies on concrete enemy and npc classes. There might be a way to reduce concrete classes implementation while not affecting the functionality.
