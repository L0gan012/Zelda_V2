Specific comments on code quality
	Good, well organized code.
Specific comments on code quality:
	Good naming conventions
	I like the use of Contract.Requires() instead of if statement null checking.  It's much easier to read.
	Code organization is good. Fairly low coupling given that you can't avoid bringing in two different game object types.
Hypothetical change:
	It isn't clear from the code which object is being given the CollisionSide. This could be difficult for someone coming later to maintain the code.
