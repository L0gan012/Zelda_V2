Specific comments on code quality
	Good, well organized code.
Specific comments on code quality:
	Good naming conventions
	I believe only the following using directives are necessary for this file.
		using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content;
		using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics;
		using Sprint2.Sprite;
	The LoadAllTextures method could make use of the TextureContent class to load up the contentDictionary with the names already supplied by the .png files.  Using TextureContent method would simplify future additions
	of new block types by eliminating having to change any part of the LoadAllTextures method. 
Hypothetical change:
	Should we decide to make a number of different dungeons and wanted to have the same types of block patterns, but with many different colors.  The way it is currently set up would require adding in a new graphic to supply
	the new color scheme.  Perhaps, a color property should be added in, so we can have many color blocks without needing to add more graphics files.
