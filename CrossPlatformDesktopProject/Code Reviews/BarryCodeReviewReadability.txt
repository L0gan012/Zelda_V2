Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
	What is readable:
		Code is very easy to read.  The block classes have been structured very nicely to keep the code short, simple and easy to understand.
		
	What isn't readable:
		There isn't any comment to really help understand why .6 is being used in the Rectangle.
